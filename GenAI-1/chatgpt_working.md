# 🧠 How ChatGPT Works (Step by Step)

This document explains how ChatGPT (based on the Transformer
architecture) works when you type a prompt.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Pretraining (Learning Phase)

-   ChatGPT is trained on a massive dataset of text.
-   During this phase, it **learns language patterns, grammar, facts,
    reasoning, and relationships between words**.
-   Uses **self-supervised learning** by predicting the next token in
    huge amounts of text.
-   This happens **before deployment**, not while you are chatting.

✅ Pretraining → **Parallel** processing (huge GPU clusters).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Transformer & Self-Attention (Understanding Input)

-   When you enter a prompt, ChatGPT uses the **Transformer
    architecture**.
-   Inside a Transformer, the **self-attention mechanism** checks how
    every token (word or subword) relates to all other tokens.
-   This gives **contextual meaning** (e.g., it knows "bank" means
    riverbank or money-bank depending on the sentence).

✅ Self-attention → **Parallel inside Transformer** (very fast).

⚠️ At this stage: ChatGPT has **not generated output yet**, it is just
understanding your input.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Inference (Text Generation / Output Phase)

-   After understanding the input, ChatGPT generates tokens one by one.
-   Each new token depends on the **previous tokens** already generated
    (sequential).
-   Example:
    -   Input: "The cat sat on the"
    -   Model predicts next token: "mat"
    -   Then continues predicting the next one, and so on.

⚠️ Text generation → **Sequential across tokens**\
✅ But **parallel inside each token computation**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Important Notes

-   Transformer **does not suggest the full output at once**.\
-   Instead, it **understands the whole input first**, then **predicts
    output tokens step by step**.
-   This makes the conversation flow **natural and adaptive**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔑 Summary

1.  **Pretraining** → Learns language (done before chat, parallel).\
2.  **Transformer + Self-attention** → Understands full input
    (parallel).\
3.  **Inference (text generation)** → Produces output step by step
    (sequential).

➡️ So, when you type a prompt, ChatGPT first builds a **contextual
understanding** of your full input using Transformer self-attention, and
only then it starts generating the response token by token.


# 🧠 How ChatGPT Works – Token Generation & Stopping Criteria

---

## 1. Input Processing
- When you type a prompt (e.g., `"Hello"`), it is broken into **tokens** (small chunks of text).
- The **Transformer model** processes all input tokens **in parallel** using **self-attention**, building a **contextual understanding** of the entire input.

---

## 2. Token Generation
- The model **does not output the whole response at once**.
- Instead, it generates **one token at a time**:
  - It predicts the **most probable next token** based on the input + already generated tokens.
  - This process is **sequential across tokens** but **parallel inside each token’s computation**.

---

## 3. When Does It Stop?
The model knows when to stop generating because of **special tokens**:

- **End-of-Sequence (EOS) Token** → Tells the model that the response is complete.
- **Max Token Limit** → If EOS is not produced, generation stops after reaching the limit.
- **Human-defined stop sequences** → Developers can set custom rules like `"\nUser:"` to force stopping.

---

## 4. Example Walkthrough
**Prompt:**  

**Steps:**
1. `"Hello"` → tokenized and context built.
2. Model predicts next token → `"there"`.
3. Sequence so far: `"Hello there"`.
4. Next token predicted → `"!"`.
5. Sequence so far: `"Hello there!"`.
6. Model generates EOS token → stops output.

✅ Final Output:  


---

## 5. Key Insights
- The **Transformer first understands the input** (context building).
- Then it **generates tokens one by one** (sequential prediction).
- It **stops when EOS or rules are triggered**.

# Tokenization and Models

## 🔹 What is Tokenization?
- Tokenization is the process of breaking down text (prompt or output) into smaller units called **tokens**.  
- A token can be:
  - A whole word (`dog`)
  - A part of a word (`play`, `ing`)
  - Even punctuation or whitespace.

---

## 🔹 Does Tokenization Depend on the Model?
✅ Yes, it depends on the **tokenizer** used by the model.  
Different models are trained with different tokenizers, which means:
- The same sentence may break into **different tokens** for different models.
- Example:
  - GPT-2 tokenizer: `"playing"` → `["play", "ing"]`
  - GPT-4 tokenizer: `"playing"` → `["playing"]` (treated as one token).

---

## 🔹 Why Different Tokenizers?
- Tokenizer choice affects:
  - **Efficiency**: fewer tokens → faster processing.
  - **Memory usage**: fewer tokens → less compute cost.
  - **Accuracy**: better handling of languages, slang, emojis, etc.

---

## 🔹 Prompt Splitting
- When you send a prompt to ChatGPT:
  1. The **tokenizer of that model** splits your text into tokens.
  2. These tokens are fed into the **transformer layers**.
  3. The model then predicts the next token step by step.

---
```java

## 🔹 Example
Sentence: `"I love pizza 🍕"`

- GPT-3.5 Tokenization (hypothetical):
["I", " love", " pizza", " 🍕"]

bash
Copy
Edit

- Another model’s tokenizer might split differently:
["I", " love", " piz", "za", " 🍕"]

yaml
Copy
Edit

---
👉 So yes, prompt splitting (tokenization) depends on the model’s tokenizer.

🔹 What is a Model’s Tokenizer?

A tokenizer is like a translator that breaks down text into smaller pieces (called tokens) before giving it to a model like me (GPT).

The model doesn’t understand raw text (words/sentences) directly — it only works with numbers.
So, the tokenizer’s job is to:

Split text into tokens (words, subwords, or even characters).

Map tokens to numbers (IDs) using a vocabulary.

Send those IDs to the model for processing.

🔹 Example

Text:

I love coding!


Tokenizer might break it like this (depends on model type):

"I" → token 100

" love" → token 567

" coding" → token 9823

"!" → token 21

So internally the model sees:

[100, 567, 9823, 21]

🔹 Why Tokenization?

It makes huge vocabulary manageable.

Helps handle rare words (e.g., “Himanshuvaishy” might be split into smaller subwords: “Him”, “anshu”, “vaishy”).

Ensures consistency across training and inference.

🔹 Types of Tokenizers

Word-level → splits text by spaces (not used much now, because vocabulary explodes).

"I love coding" → ["I", "love", "coding"]

Character-level → each character is a token.

"coding" → ["c", "o", "d", "i", "n", "g"]

Subword-level (most common) → break into meaningful chunks.

"unbelievable" → ["un", "believ", "able"]

Modern models like GPT, BERT, LLaMA use subword tokenizers (Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece, SentencePiece).

👉 In short:
A model’s tokenizer is the first step in the pipeline that converts human-readable text into tokens (numbers) the model can actually process.
