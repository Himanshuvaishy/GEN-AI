# Prompt Engineering & Prompting Styles

## 1. What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is the practice of crafting effective prompts (questions, instructions, or inputs) to guide large language models (LLMs) like GPT to generate accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses.  
Since LLMs don’t “understand” in the same way humans do, the way you ask a question heavily influences the quality of the output.  
It is a critical skill for developers, researchers, and anyone working with AI systems.

## 2. Why is Prompt Engineering Important?

- Helps improve **accuracy** of responses.  
- Reduces **ambiguity** and **hallucinations** (made-up answers).  
- Saves time by reducing the need for repeated queries.  
- Allows developers to **customize outputs** for specific tasks.  
- Forms the basis of **AI applications** like chatbots, code assistants, and data analysis tools.

## 3. Common Prompting Styles

### 3.1 Zero-shot Prompting
- Asking a model to perform a task **without examples**.  
- Example:  
  *"Translate the following sentence into French: 'How are you?'"*

### 3.2 One-shot Prompting
- Providing **a single example** to guide the model.  
- Example:  
  *"Translate the following into French.*  
   Example: 'Good morning' → 'Bonjour'  
   Now translate: 'How are you?'"*

### 3.3 Few-shot Prompting
- Giving the model **a few examples** before asking it to solve a new query.  
- Example:  
  *"Translate the following into French.*  
   'Good morning' → 'Bonjour'  
   'Good night' → 'Bonne nuit'  
   Now translate: 'How are you?'"*

### 3.4 Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT)
- Encourages the model to **show reasoning steps** instead of jumping to the final answer.  
- Example:  
  *"If a train travels 60 km in 1 hour, how long will it take to travel 180 km?  
   Think step by step."*

### 3.5 Role-based Prompting
- Assigning the model a **specific role** to answer more contextually.  
- Example:  
  *"You are a professional JavaScript tutor. Explain closures with an example."*

### 3.6 Instruction-based Prompting
- Giving the model **direct instructions** with clear tasks.  
- Example:  
  *"Summarize this paragraph in three bullet points."*

### 3.7 Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (Hybrid)
- Combining **few-shot examples** with **step-by-step reasoning**.  
- Example:  
  *"Here are some math problems solved step by step... Now solve this new one step by step."*

## 4. Best Practices in Prompt Engineering

- Be **clear and specific** in your instructions.  
- Provide **context** when needed.  
- Use **constraints** (e.g., "in less than 50 words").  
- Break down complex tasks into **smaller steps**.  
- Experiment with different prompting styles.  
- Iterate and refine prompts for better results.

## 5. Conclusion

Prompt engineering is like **giving directions to a very smart assistant**.  
The clearer and more structured your request, the better the output.  
Mastering different **prompting styles** allows you to unlock the full potential of AI models.
