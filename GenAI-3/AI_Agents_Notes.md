# 📘 Notes on AI Agents & Agentic Workflows

## 🔹 What are AI Agents?
- An **AI Tool** is like a calculator — does only one specific task when asked.
- An **AI Agent** is smarter:
  - Can plan steps to achieve a goal.
  - Can choose which tool to use.
  - Can act autonomously (without being told every single step).

### 👉 Analogy
- **Tool = Screwdriver 🔧**
- **Agent = Mechanic 👨‍🔧** (decides tools + fixes problem).

## 🔹 AI Agents in Action (Example)
**Travel Booking Agent:**
1. Takes your request: *"Book me the cheapest flight to Delhi."*
2. Searches multiple websites (uses APIs/tools).
3. Compares prices.
4. Books the ticket.
5. Sends confirmation.

---

## 🔹 Agentic Workflow (Step-by-Step)
1. **Understand the Goal** (input from user).
2. **Make a Plan** (decide steps).
3. **Select Tool(s)** (APIs, search, calculator, etc.).
4. **Take Action** (execute).
5. **Check Result/Progress**.
6. **Repeat if needed** until ✅ goal is achieved.

## 🔹 Visual Flow
```
User Request → [Agent]
              ↓
       Understand Goal
              ↓
          Make a Plan
              ↓
       Select Right Tool(s)
              ↓
           Take Action
              ↓
       Check Result/Progress
              ↓
     Goal Achieved? → Yes → ✅ Done
                     No  → 🔄 Retry
```

---

## 🔹 Key Difference: Tools vs Agents
- **Tools** = Do tasks when asked.
- **Agents** = Decide tasks + Use tools + Achieve goals autonomously.

---

## ✅ Summary
AI Agents are like smart assistants that **plan, act, and reflect** until your goal is complete.  
Agentic Workflows = **Plan + Act + Reflect + Retry → Until Done**.
